I've been working from home since mid-March. This has afforded me the opportunity to listen to more of my collection of LPs and CDs than I might normally. But how much more?

## ECM

```{r}

ecm <- df_playlist %>% 
  filter(str_detect(label, "ECM")) %>% 
  drop_na(year) %>% 
  mutate(play_date = make_date(year, month, day)) %>% 
  select(artist, 
         album, 
         format,
         play_date)

#%>% 
#  filter(play_date > as_date("2017-03-31"))

ecm
```

### most played

artist

```{r}

ecm %>% 
  group_by(artist) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

```

album

```{r}

ecm %>% 
  group_by(artist, album) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

```


only played once

```{r}

ecm_min <- ecm %>% 
#  filter(format == LP) %>% 
  group_by(artist, album) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  filter(n == 1)
  
ecm_min

```


### most/least recently played


most recent

```{r}

ecm %>% 
  select(artist, album, format, play_date) %>% 
  arrange(desc(play_date))

```

least recent (longest ago)

```{r}

ecm %>% 
  semi_join(ecm_min, by = c("artist", "album")) %>% 
  select(album, artist, play_date)

```



### ECM lps

longest-ago played LPs

```{r}

ecm %>% 
  filter(format == "LP") %>% 
  group_by(artist, album) %>% 
  summarise(last_played = max(play_date)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  slice_min(order_by = last_played, n = 10)
  

```

Longest ago played, where have LP (i.e. if it was played via another format, it gets skipped)

```{r}
ecm_last_played <- ecm %>% 
  group_by(artist, album) %>% 
  summarise(last_played = max(play_date)) %>% 
  ungroup()

ecm_last_played

# check unique
ecm_last_played %>% 
  group_by(artist, album) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  filter(n > 1)

# create list of unique ECM LPs
ecm_lp <- ecm %>%
  filter(format == "LP") %>% 
  distinct(artist, album)

# join, slice with 10 least recently played
ecm_lp %>% 
  left_join(ecm_last_played, by = c("artist", "album")) %>% 
  slice_min(order_by = last_played, n = 10)
  

```



last played

```{r}

ecm %>% 
  filter(format == "LP") %>% 
  group_by(artist, album) %>% 
  summarise(last_played = max(play_date)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = last_played, n = 5)
  

```


## Pat Metheny

```{r}

metheny <- df_playlist %>% 
  filter(str_detect(artist, "Metheny")) %>% 
  drop_na(year) %>% 
  mutate(play_date = make_date(year, month, day)) %>% 
  select(artist, 
         album, 
         format,
         play_date)

metheny

```

### most played
